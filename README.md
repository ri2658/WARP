# WARP

This is **WARP** (**W**ildfire **A**dversarial **R**obustness **P**rotocol),
the official code repository for the paper "Adversarial Robustness for Deep Learning-based Wildfire
Prediction Models.

This repository contains the code for the following:

- An initial sanity check using Gaussian noise
- A deception test using PNG-noise patches
- Weights of two pre-trained models (YOLOv8 and RT-DETR) for wildfire smoke detection
- Utility tools

Regular updates, debugging, and optimization should be expected.
