# WARP

## Description
This is **WARP** (**W**ildfire **A**dversarial **R**obustness **P**rocedure),
the official code repository for the paper "Adversarial Robustness for Deep Learning-based Wildfire
Prediction Models.

This repository contains the code for the following:

- A global sanity check using Gaussian noise
- A local deception test using PNG-noise patches
- Weights of two pre-trained models
  (YOLOv8 and RT-DETR) for wildfire smoke detection
- Utility tools

Expect regular updates, debugging, and optimization!
