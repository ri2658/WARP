Alternatively, the Testing Dataset collected from HPWREN by Govil et al. (2020) can be found here:

Additional pre-processing steps may be necessary to standardize the format for the models. <br />
So far, Yazdi et al. (2022) have provided a [tool](https://github.com/SayBender/Nemo/blob/main/nemo_COCOnvert.ipynb) to convert the HPWREN data into COCO format.
